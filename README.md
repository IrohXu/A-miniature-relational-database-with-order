My miniature relational database's parser and compiler is based on pandas_parser(https://github.com/conychou/pandas_parser).  
The operation is based on Prof. Wang's note.  

All of the code is written by myself except for the code in folder sly, which is contained in pandas_parser.
All of the python package in my code is legal, they are: re, bisect, time. Do not include any SOL library!

Run 'python compiler.py', you can start to test my code.

Thanks for checking my project.
Best regards

Merry Christmas
